This repository is going to be for my personal projects. 

My first project is Project_I (named that way for no reason whatsoever, but my name begins with an I), which was initially intended to be a project to brush up on some Python skills, but has grown from it's roots into a script which defines a Neural Network class. This class can be used to initialise a Neural Network, pass in data, and learn via backpropagation.
